1. Overview

The Unizulu Chatbot is a simple web-based chatbot application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean, responsive design with a dark-themed background overlay, a light chat container, and interactive chat functionality. The chatbot allows users to input text, which can span multiple lines, and simulates bot responses.

3. Detailed Explanation
3.1. HTML (index.html)

The HTML file creates the structure of the chatbot interface. Key elements include:

    Header:
        Displays the title "Unizulu Chatbot" at the top of the page.
    Chat Container:
        A central section containing the chatbox (where conversations appear) and the user input area.
    Background Overlay:
        A div that adds a dark overlay over the background image, ensuring readability.

3.2. CSS (styles.css)

The CSS file manages the visual presentation of the web app. It includes:

    Background Overlay:
        A darkened layer over the background image, achieved through the background-blend-mode: overlay property.
    Chat Container:
        A light-colored (white or greyish) box for the chat content, designed for clarity against the dark background.
    Text Wrapping:
        Ensures that text within the chatbox and input area wraps correctly, preventing horizontal scrolling.
    Responsive Design:
        Ensures the web app is visually appealing and functional on various screen sizes.

3.3. JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file manages the chatbot's interactive behavior, including:

    Sending Messages:
        Captures user input and displays it in the chatbox.
    Simulating Bot Responses:
        Automatically generates a basic response from the chatbot.
    Handling Text Input:
        Allows users to send messages by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Send" button.

4. Usage Instructions

    Add Background Image:
        In styles.css, replace the placeholder with the actual path to your background image.

    Run the Web App:
        Open index.html in a web browser. The chatbot interface should load with the dark overlay background and the chat container in the center.

    Interacting with the Chatbot:
        Type a message in the text area and press "Enter" or click the "Send" button to send the message.
        The chatbot will display a simulated response after a short delay.

5. Customization Options

    Colors:
        Modify the color scheme in styles.css to fit your preferences or institutional branding.

    Bot Responses:
        Enhance the JavaScript in script.js to provide more advanced or contextual responses.

    Input Area:
        Adjust the initial height of the textarea and its resize behavior as needed in styles.css.

6. Future Enhancements

    Backend Integration:
        Connect the chatbot to a backend (e.g., Python Flask) and a database (e.g., Firebase) to handle more complex queries and store chat logs.

    Natural Language Processing:
        Implement NLP to enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user input more intelligently.
